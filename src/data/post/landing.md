## Universal Migration Process (All Platforms)

Regardless of source platform, successful migrations follow this framework:

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (2-4 weeks)

**1.1 Data Audit:**
- Catalog size: How many products, variants, categories?
- Data quality: Missing descriptions, broken images, inconsistent attributes?
- Customer data: Account count, segmentation needs
- Order history: How far back to migrate? (recommend 2-3 years max)

**1.2 Functionality Mapping:**
Create spreadsheet documenting current functionality:
- Feature name
- Platform: Plugin/extension providing it
- Usage frequency
- Business criticality (1-5 scale)
- Shopify equivalent (app or custom dev)
- Migration approach

**1.3 SEO Preservation Strategy:**
- Export current URL structure
- Identify high-traffic pages (Google Analytics)
- Map old URLs to new Shopify URLs
- Plan 301 redirect implementation

**1.4 Design Direction:**
- Migrate current design (adapt existing theme)
- Redesign opportunity (new Shopify theme)
- Hybrid: Keep branding, modernize UX

**1.5 Timeline & Budget:**
Based on audit, create detailed:
- Week-by-week migration plan
- Resource allocation (who does what)
- Budget with 20% contingency
- Go-live date (avoid peak seasons if possible)

### Phase 2: Environment Setup (1-2 weeks)

**2.1 Shopify Account:**
- Select appropriate plan (standard vs Plus)
- Configure domain (keep old site live during migration)
- Use password-protected development store

**2.2 Theme Selection/Development:**
- Purchase or build theme
- Configure basic branding (logo, colors, fonts)
- Set up demo products for testing

**2.3 Essential Apps:**
Install core apps early to understand data structure:
- Email marketing (Klaviyo, Omnisend)
- Reviews (Judge.me, Yotpo)
- Loyalty (Smile.io, LoyaltyLion)
- Analytics (if beyond native Shopify analytics)

### Phase 3: Data Migration (2-6 weeks)

**3.1 Product Migration:**

**Automated Tools:**
- Cart2Cart: Connect platforms, select data, migrate
- LitExtension: Similar functionality to Cart2Cart
- Matrixify (formerly Excelify): CSV-based, powerful for custom mappings

**Manual/Custom Migration:**
For complex catalogs, custom scripts provide control:
- Export data from source platform (CSV or API)
- Transform data (clean, map fields, handle variants)
- Import to Shopify (CSV or API)

**3.2 Customer Migration:**

Migrate customer accounts WITHOUT passwords (security best practice):
- Customers receive "reset password" email on first Shopify visit
- Or use Shopify's Multipass feature (Plus only) for seamless login

**Data to Migrate:**
- Email, name, addresses
- Customer tags/segments
- Order history (for context, not re-processing)
- Account notes (for customer service reference)

**3.3 Content Migration:**

**Blog Posts:**
- Export from WordPress/Magento (XML, CSV)
- Import to Shopify blog (CSV or manually)
- Update internal links, images

**Pages:**
- Recreate static pages (About, Contact, Policies)
- Update menu navigation
- Ensure legal pages (Privacy, Terms) are current

**3.4 SEO Metadata:**
- Migrate page titles, meta descriptions
- Set up URL redirects (covered in Phase 4)
- Transfer alt tags for images

### Phase 4: SEO Preservation (1-2 weeks)

**Critical: This Makes or Breaks Migration Success**

**4.1 URL Mapping:**

Create CSV mapping every old URL to new Shopify URL. Document all product pages, collections, blog posts, and static pages.

**4.2 Redirect Implementation:**

**Shopify Native Redirects:**
- Shopify admin to Navigation to URL Redirects
- Add redirects manually or bulk CSV import
- Limit: 50,000 redirects (sufficient for most stores)

**For over 50,000 redirects:**
- Use app like Redirect Manager (Shopify app)
- Or implement server-level redirects if using Shopify Plus

**4.3 Redirect Types:**

**301 (Permanent):** Use for all product, category, page migrations  
**302 (Temporary):** Never use for migrations (confuses search engines)

**4.4 Post-Migration SEO Checklist:**

- Submit new sitemap to Google Search Console
- Monitor Google Analytics for traffic drops
- Check Search Console for crawl errors
- Fix any broken links found
- Monitor keyword rankings for 60 days

**Expected SEO Impact:**
- Minor dip (5-10%) in first 2-4 weeks is normal
- Recovery to baseline: 4-8 weeks
- Often see improvement by week 12 due to Shopify's better performance

### Phase 5: Testing & QA (1-2 weeks)

**5.1 Functionality Testing:**

Test every customer-facing workflow:
- Product browsing, filtering, search
- Add to cart, cart updates, checkout
- Payment processing (test mode first, then live)
- Order confirmation emails
- Customer account creation/login
- Password reset flows

**5.2 Cross-Browser/Device Testing:**

Test on:
- Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- Tablet: iPad, Android tablets

**5.3 Load Testing:**

Simulate traffic spikes (especially pre-launch):
- Use tools like Loader.io, BlazeMeter
- Ensure checkout handles concurrent users
- Test during high-traffic scenarios (flash sale simulation)

**5.4 SEO/Technical Audit:**

- All redirects working correctly
- No broken images or links
- Proper structured data (schema.org markup)
- Page load times under 3 seconds
- Mobile usability (Google's Mobile-Friendly Test)

**5.5 User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**

Have non-technical team members test:
- Can they complete purchase without help?
- Is navigation intuitive?
- Does design match brand expectations?
- Are there confusing elements?

### Phase 6: Launch & Monitoring (1-2 weeks)

**6.1 Pre-Launch Checklist:**

**24-48 Hours Before:**
- Final data sync (new orders, inventory updates)
- Remove password protection from Shopify store
- Prepare DNS changes (but don't apply yet)
- Alert team and stakeholders of launch window

**Launch Day (Low-Traffic Time Recommended):**
- Update DNS to point to Shopify
- DNS propagation: 24-48 hours (but often faster)
- Monitor website accessibility globally
- Test checkout flow immediately

**6.2 Post-Launch Monitoring:**

**First 24 Hours:**
- Monitor website uptime
- Check order processing (test orders converting?)
- Monitor Google Analytics for traffic
- Watch for customer support tickets indicating issues

**First Week:**
- Review Google Search Console for crawl errors
- Monitor conversion rate versus pre-migration baseline
- Check email deliverability (order confirmations arriving?)
- Gather team feedback on admin usability

**First Month:**
- Compare sales versus same period last year
- Track SEO metrics (keyword rankings, organic traffic)
- Identify and fix any lingering issues
- Optimize based on new Shopify analytics insights

### Phase 7: Optimization & Training (Ongoing)

**7.1 Team Training:**

**Admin Training (2-4 hours):**
- Product management
- Order processing
- Customer service tools
- Inventory management
- Discount codes and promotions

**Marketing Training (1-2 hours):**
- Email marketing platform integration
- Analytics review
- A/B testing setup

**7.2 Conversion Rate Optimization:**

Post-migration is perfect time for optimization:
- A/B test checkout flow
- Optimize product pages (better images, descriptions)
- Implement upsells/cross-sells
- Add customer reviews

**7.3 App Ecosystem Exploration:**

Gradually add apps addressing needs:
- Advanced email flows (abandoned cart, win-back)
- SMS marketing (Postscript, Attentive)
- Loyalty programs
- Advanced analytics

## Common Migration Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Migrating Everything

**Problem:** Trying to replicate every feature from old platform.

**Reality:** 30-40% of functionality goes unused. Migration is an opportunity to audit and simplify.

**Solution:**
- Review analytics for feature usage
- Retire unused functionality
- Focus on features driving revenue

### Mistake 2: Ignoring SEO Until After Migration

**Problem:** Treating SEO as post-launch activity leads to traffic loss.

**Solution:**
- Plan redirects during discovery phase
- Implement redirects before DNS change
- Monitor Search Console throughout

### Mistake 3: Launching During Peak Season

**Problem:** Migrating in November (pre-Black Friday) creates unnecessary risk.

**Solution:**
- Migrate during slow periods (January-March ideal)
- Allow 2-3 months buffer before peak season
- If timing is unavoidable, extend testing phase

### Mistake 4: Underestimating Timeline

**Problem:** "Two-week migration" becomes three months.

**Reality:** Data migration is 30% of work. Design, testing, optimization are the other 70%.

**Solution:**
- Use realistic timelines from this guide
- Add 20-30% buffer to estimates
- Accept that quality migrations take time

### Mistake 5: Skipping the Staging Environment

**Problem:** Making changes directly on live site post-migration.

**Solution:**
- Maintain development/staging store
- Test changes before pushing live
- Use Shopify's Theme Preview for design updates

### Mistake 6: Not Training the Team

**Problem:** Team struggles with new platform, creating friction.

**Solution:**
- Schedule training sessions pre-launch
- Create documentation/videos
- Allocate time for team to explore admin

### Mistake 7: Forgetting About Emails

**Problem:** Transactional emails (order confirmations) use old branding or broken links.

**Solution:**
- Customize Shopify email templates
- Test all email types (order, shipping, refund)
- Ensure email deliverability (SPF, DKIM records)

## Conclusion: Migration as Strategic Opportunity

Platform migration isn't just a technical exercise—it's a strategic reset. Moving to Shopify eliminates technical debt, reduces operational overhead, and positions your business on modern infrastructure designed for growth.

**Key Takeaways:**

**For WooCommerce Merchants:**
Escape server management, security stress, and plugin conflicts. Shopify's simplicity may feel limiting initially, but operational efficiency gains compound over time.

**For Magento Merchants:**
Trade complexity for speed. You'll lose some advanced features but gain velocity. Most Magento capabilities have Shopify equivalents—they just work differently.

**For BigCommerce Merchants:**
Lateral move with better app ecosystem and user experience. If BigCommerce's variant limits or customization restrictions are constraining growth, Shopify removes those barriers.

**For All Merchants:**
Prioritize SEO preservation, plan thoroughly, and treat migration as a project spanning 2-6 months—not a weekend task. The operational benefits and reduced technical overhead make the investment worthwhile for growing e-commerce businesses.
